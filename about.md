<p class="message">
  Howdy! My name is Frank Blandon and I am a software developer living in St. Pete Florida. I have been doing software development professionaly for over six years, most of which has been in the financial world using JavaEE - and everything that comes with that.
I like to deliver code that is readable, clean and maintainable. On top of all else, I'm a team player and value communication.
